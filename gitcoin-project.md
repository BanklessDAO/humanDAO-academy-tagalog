In July, the Bankless Academy Squad participated in [ETH Barcelona](https://www.ethbarcelona.com/), the second edition of Spain's most significant web3 gathering. During this event, our team hosted its **inaugural in-person workshop** titled "Crypto Compass: Finding Your Path in Web3." The workshop was met with resounding success, evident in both the attendance and engagement levels. Following the event, we received numerous requests from various Ethereum-focused gatherings worldwide. This enthusiastic response has opened an exciting avenue for Bankless Academy, paving the way for **in real life learning events** that transform knowledge sharing and online educational tools into immersive experiences with a substantial impact.

In the upcoming months, we're committed to expanding these valuable experiences to a broader audience of #BanklessExplorers across the globe.
