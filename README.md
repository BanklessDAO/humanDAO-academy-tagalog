## How to import content from Notion

### Where to update the content

[https://www.notion.so/bankless/1dd77eb6ed4147f6bdfd6f23a30baa46](https://www.notion.so/bankless/1dd77eb6ed4147f6bdfd6f23a30baa46)

### Default content import command

```bash
yarn import-content
```

### Import content with a specific Notion ID

```

### How does it work

The [import script](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-academy/blob/main/import-content.js) connects to a custom unofficial Notion API called Potion [https://github.com/didierkrux/potion](https://github.com/didierkrux/potion) and transforms the content into [this Object](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-academy/blob/main/src/constants/lessons.ts).
